    <li><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/12/05/encadrement-des-loyers-37-de-loyers-abusifs-a-paris-43-en-seine-saint-denis\_6104818\_4355770.html">Encadrement des loyers : 37 % de loyers abusifs à Paris, 43 % en Seine-Saint-Denis</a> : some major urban areas in France are rent-controlled, but there is little data of enforcement of those somewhat new policies so I scraped a major website for apartment rentals and confronted their data to the legislation. Turns out more than 1/3 of property ads were not in the right range of prices - if you don&#39;t speak French, check out the maps!</li>

<h1 id="more-about-me">More about me</h1>
<p>I speak French, English and a rusted Spanish because I was raised on the French-Spanish border.  </p>
<p>I started climbing in Stanford and basically didn&#39;t stop. I also volunteer as an EMS at Protection Civile and participate in many humanitarian actions with them.
    I also love to play volleyball, paraglide, and ski.</p>
