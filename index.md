# Papers

## As a journalist

Articles I'm most proud of:
- [Abaisser la majorité pénale, créer des centres fermés… que valent les propositions des candidats sur la justice des mineurs ?](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/12/15/abaisser-la-majorite-penale-creer-des-centres-fermes-que-valent-ces-propositions-sur-la-justice-des-mineurs\_6106189i\_4355770.html) : a deep dive into the French justice system for minors, we analysed 75+ years of modification to the seminal ruling of 1945 into a more harshed and how that compares to the discourse of French presidential candidates.
- [Encadrement des loyers : 37 % de loyers abusifs à Paris, 43 % en Seine-Saint-Denis](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/12/05/encadrement-des-loyers-37-de-loyers-abusifs-a-paris-43-en-seine-saint-denis\_6104818\_4355770.html) : some major urban areas in France are rent-controlled, but there is little data of enforcement of those somewhat new policies so I scraped a major website for apartment rentals and confronted their data to the legislation. Turns out more than 1/3 of property ads were not in the right range of prices - if you don't speak French, check out the maps!

## As a student / researcher
- [A Bregman Method for Structure Learning on Sparse Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02764) _M Romain, A d'Aspremont_
- [Adversarially learned anomaly detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594897) _H Zenati, M Romain, CS Foo, B Lecouat, V Chandrasekhar_ accepted at the 2018 IEEE International conference on data mining (ICDM)

# More about me

I speak French, English and a rusted Spanish because I was raised on the French-Spanish border.  

I started climbing in Stanford and basically didn't stop. I also volunteer as an EMS at Protection Civile and participate in many humanitarian actions with them. 
I also love to play volleyball, paraglide, and ski.
