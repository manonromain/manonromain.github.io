## As a journalist

Articles I'm most proud of: 
- (Abaisser la majorité pénale, créer des centres fermés… que valent les propositions des candidats sur la justice des mineurs ?)[https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/12/15/abaisser-la-majorite-penale-creer-des-centres-fermes-que-valent-ces-propositions-sur-la-justice-des-mineurs\_6106189i\_4355770.html] : a deep dive into the French justice system for minors, we analysed 75+ years of modification to the seminal ruling of 1945 into a more harshed and how that compares to the discourse of French presidential candidates.   
- (Encadrement des loyers : 37 % de loyers abusifs à Paris, 43 % en Seine-Saint-Denis)[https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2021/12/05/encadrement-des-loyers-37-de-loyers-abusifs-a-paris-43-en-seine-saint-denis\_6104818\_4355770.html] : some major urban areas in France are rent-controlled, but there is little data of enforcement of those somewhat new policies so I scraped a major website for apartment rentals and confronted their data to the legislation. Turns out more than 1/3 of property ads were not in the right range of prices - if you don't speak French, check out the maps!
